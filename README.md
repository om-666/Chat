 # Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built using HTML, CSS, Node.js, Socket.io, and JavaScript. You can set up and run this application on your local machine to chat in real-time with other users, even in different browser tabs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Chat Application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatApp.git
   ```

   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ChatApp
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Node.js server using [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon). In the project directory, run the following command:

   ```bash
   nodemon server
   ```

   This will start the server and make the chat application accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. You can now start chatting with other users. To chat with other users in different tabs, simply open additional tabs in your browser and access `http://localhost:3000` in each tab.
